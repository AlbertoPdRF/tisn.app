# Back end of Tisn

The back end is currently hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

The production database is currently hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/). There's a script that can be used to populate the database with interests. To run it, use the command `node db/populate 'MONGODB_URL'`.
