# Contributing to Tisn

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Proposing new features
- Reporting bugs
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting code

This document outlines the process that should be followed by contributors in order to try and acomplish that goal.

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host the code, to track feature requests and bugs, as well as accept pull requests.

### Request new features and/or report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track track feature requests and bugs. If you want to request a feature or report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/Tisn/tisn.app/issues/new/choose) choosing and filling the appropriate template; it's that easy! However, before opening a new issue, make sure that it won't be duplicated by browsing [the already existing ones](https://github.com/Tisn/tisn.app/issues).

### Propose code changes through pull requests

Pull requests are the way to propose changes to the code (we use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). Please note that before submitting any pull request there should be an issue where we can discuss about the changes to be implemented. Once we have agreed on what should be done, we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`
   - Name the branch following the `issueNumber-short-description` format (e.g. `123-add-cool-feature`)
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've made changes that should be documented, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suites pass
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Submit that pull request!
   - Make sure to mention the related issue with appropriate keywords on the pull request description (e.g. `Fixes #123`)

### Any contributions you make will be under the AGPL-3.0 License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [AGPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact us at [support@tisn.app](mailto:support@tisn.app) if that's a concern.
